AllSky7 Contributor License Agreement (AS7-CLA v1)
--------------------------------------------------

Notes
This is a default GPT generated license. This still needs discussion, review and revsion. 

Main Points
 - Contibutors must agree to license contributions to AllSky7 for our use, while still protecting the parent company/intellectual property. 

 - Contibutions should not prevent author from using the code himself, but contributing does not entitle author to rights over company project. 

 - Others (non-authors/non-company) may use code in public repo for non-commercial purposes only.
